\section{TODOS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Superblock sometimes does not get marked as unset (but marked as free)
    \item Add "how to use" to this document
    \item Add a "high space usage" mode limiting writes 
    \item Add possibility to having multiple PageAddressCaches
    \item Add check if dirty in commit Area Summaries to enable read-only (half finished)
    \item Add userdata write-back upon corrected Biterror
	\item When ASCache runs full, some used pages cant be marked as dirty. Build sanity checker, scanning whole FS and marking unreachable pages as such.
	\item Implement dynamic number of uncommitted areas to superpage. (Maybe call it Checkpoint?)
	\item TreeCache - full commit from time to time. (Maybe 'used' marker?)
	\item GC: Static Wear levelling, keep deletioncount in mind.
	\item Implement additional driver function for copying pages for optimizing.
	\item Use Inode pointer space for very small files to speed up access and save space.
	\item Implement DATA Buffer to speed up everything. Note: Low priority and high effort.
\end{itemize}
